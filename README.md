# seekwatcher

This https://github.com/trofi/seekwatcher repository is a conversion
of http://oss.oracle.com/~mason/seekwatcher/ hg repository initially
maintained and developed by Chris Mason.

I personally don't intent to add any new features to original
`seekwatcher` by Chris Mason and would like to apply only minimal
fixes to make it work for modern dependencies.

Until you know what you are doing please consider using `iowatcher` instead:

- http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/mason/iowatcher.git

`iowatcher` reference: https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-btrace/msg00869.html
